# Relection on Milestone4

## Features Implemented

Since this is the last week of development, we primarily worked on making the dashboard production ready and incorporating the various feedback that we received. The feedback that we received (both from the TA and peer feedback) was very helpful in improving our dashboard. We were able to implement all of the suggestions made by Joel and Andy. We also worked on the peer feedback. We alse setup Heroku's GitHub integration to automate your deploys. Here is the [link](https://moveymoney.herokuapp.com/) for the deployed app on Herokuapp.com. The updates that we made this week include:-

1. We added collapse buttons to display more information for all the plots and also general information and purpose of the dashboard.

2. We added author information and provided links to the github repo and also to the original source of the data.

3. We applied styling to further improve the look of the dashboard.

4. We modified the line plots to be side-by-side and share a common legend. We also modified the Y-axis labelling to be more readable.

5. Implemented LOESS to smoothen the lineplots

6. We improved the look of the heatmap (changed rectangular tiles to square tiles)

7. We polished the look of the table for the "find some potential actors" plot. We also added functionality to see all the actors rather than just the top 5.

8. We added a title banner rather than just having plain text to make it look more appealing.

## Potential improvements

While we were able to achieve almost all the features that we initialy wanted and also could work on the changes suggested in the feedback, there are 1 additional feature that we would have liked to implement, given more time which is:-

- Have a clickable link to an actor's Wiki or IMDB page in the "find some potential actors" plot.
