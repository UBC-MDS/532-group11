# Description of the app

The app contains a landing page with 4 key visualizations, each of them allowing the user to answer a different question. These are :-

1. Genre vs Rating (Heatmap):

The user will be able to select movie genres of interest from a dropdown (that allows multiple selections) and would be able to see a heat map which depicts the ratings that movies belonging to a particular category have received. This would help the user to answer the question - Which genres tend to be well received by audiences? This would allow ,say, a movie producer to make a more informed decision on the kind of movie to produce.

2. Genre vs Budget (Line plot):

The user will be able to select movie genres of interest from a dropdown (that allows multiple selections) and would see a line plot that shows the average budget of producing a movie based on the genre. This would help provide insights to answer the question - How much money does it take, on average, to produce a movie of a particular genre. Another question could be - given a certain budget what genre of movie could one produce?

3. Actor suggestions based on genre, movie budget and past ratings:

This would help a user ((like a movie producer) to find lead actors to star in their movies. The user  can select a genre and their budget, and the app will suggest actors whom they could hire. The search results can be sorted by average ratings of the actors’ previous movies or profit that an actor’s past movies have made. There would also be a filter for ‘year’ which the user can modify so that more recent actors are suggested rather than those who worked in, say, the 1960s.

4. Release month vs Profit made:

This would help the user to plan the release month for their movie. The user will be able to visualise the profit made by movies depending on which month they were released. The user needs to select a genre and also a range of years that he wants to filter for. The dashboard will then display the average profit made by movies grouped by their month of release. This would help the producer make a more informed choice on when to release their movie.
